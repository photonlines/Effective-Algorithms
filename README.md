## Effective Algorithms

### Description

This is a small collection of algorithms and data structures implemented 'Effective Java' style (in reference to the masterpiece writted by Joshua Bloch : [Effective Java (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/). The algorithms were implemented quite a while ago and are there mostly for educational purposes. You can also reference a general checklist which was used to follow the principles outlined in the book in the effective-checklist folder. 

A newer edition of the book is available and you can find it here: [Effective Java (3rd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997).
